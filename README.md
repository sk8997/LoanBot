This project seeks to streamline and optimize the loan application process, promoting greater efficiency and effectiveness. To this end, the Loan Bot leverages sophisticated machine learning algorithms to accurately predict an individual's income range and the likelihood of default on a given loan amount. These two key factors serve as critical determinants in establishing the most suitable interest rate for the user, ensuring a tailored and optimal borrowing experience. The Loan Bot's user-friendly interface and intuitive design serve to alleviate the often daunting nature of loan applications.

The significance of this project extends far beyond its immediate impact on loan application processes, and has wide-ranging implications for financial decision-making. By leveraging cutting-edge technology to accurately predict the most appropriate interest rate based on an individual's financial information, the Loan Bot outperforms traditional methods, yielding greater expected financial gains.

To illustrate our findings, we conducted a simulation of 100,000 risk values ranging from 0 to 1, sourced from a gamma distribution with K = 2 and mean = 0.07. Using the expected value of a binomial distribution (i.e., repeated trial with probability p), we calculated the potential financial loss. Conversely, we computed the potential gains based on the assigned interest rates derived from our model, as well as a flat 10% rate. The resulting outcomes are presented below for your consideration:
